                <h3 >Setting</h3>
                <p>
                    In One Piece the world's surface is the Blue Sea, a body of saltwater broadly divided into quadrants:
                    the East Blue, the West Blue, the North Blue, and the South Blue.
                    These divisions are formed by two barriers:
                    <ul>
                        <li style= "font-weight: bold;" >
                            The Grand line : A gigantic sea route that circles around the planet, stretching from west to east.
                        </li>
                        <li style= "font-weight: bold;" >
                            The Red line : Made of reddish mineral.It is said to go 10,000 meters deep from the surface of the sea to Fish-Man Island at the ocean floor.
                            At the same time, the top of the Red Line is high enough above sea level to be considered impassable. The Red Line is also indestructible.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    All parts of the Blue Sea including the Grand line contain numerous islands supporting many different degrees of life.
                    Travel between these islands is relatively simple within the four Blues, but significantly more complex in the Grand Line,
                    where many islands produce unique magnetic fields that will make ordinary compasses useless as well as more hazards,
                    a special compasses call "Log Pose" is needed to travel between islands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the world of One Piece there are many mysteries as well as beings that have special powers these special powers is giving by a fruits:
                    <ul>
                        <li style= "font-weight: bold;" >
                            Devil Fruits : Are mysterious, distinctive fruits scattered throughout the world,
                            known for granting their eaters permanent superhuman powers in return of permanent inability to swim.

                    </ul>
